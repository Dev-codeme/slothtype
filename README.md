### Project Description

This project is a typing simulator that essentially lets you... type. It doesn't improve your typing skills, doesn't track your progress, and certainly won‚Äôt make you faster. It's just here to let you type some random text and see letters pop up‚Äîan absolutely pointless exercise in pressing keys!. You can only click one letter in one second therefore it creates a frustrating typing environment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We're tackling the monumental problem of... boredom! Ever felt like typing meaningless text just for the sake of watching letters appear on the screen? Well, now you can! It‚Äôs the ultimate solution for people who have absolutely nothing better to do. üéâ

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre solving it by giving you a digital sandbox where typing becomes an event! With every keystroke, letters slide across the screen, your on-screen keyboard lights up, and you get to experience the thrill of... hitting the spacebar! It's like a party for your fingers, minus any actual productivity. üéà
